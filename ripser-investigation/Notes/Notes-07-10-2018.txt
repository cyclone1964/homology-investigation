Things to check:

Is it doing what we think it should do? Make a simples case and check
it out: this will have to have at least 5 points in it.

Can we randomize the gene sets in case the first N are biased insome way.

Try adding a uniform random number to each distance to see if we get
more simplices.

Sanity check the distance computation.

Work on Noah's data set (16S) not mine (16ggs).

Modify createLowerDistanceMatrix to:

Allow for picking every N'th gy (--decimation)
Provide a regexp for the name that is queried (--species)
