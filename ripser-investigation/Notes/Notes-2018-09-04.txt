Consider finding how quickly we can find an optimal cluster radius for
another clustering algroithm (k-means, entropy search).

Go code for ES protein structure search. Big data set.

Put them on the surface of the tube

Tree variant ... I can do this. He has an example.

asymptote - vector graphics (sourceforge.net)

Meandering data set with variable density

Empirically benchmare Entropy Scaling Search for improvement over
linear search.

Get the optimal cluster radius from the barcodes, compare to a grid
search based optimization.

Do this for different data sets, thickness, densities, etc.
