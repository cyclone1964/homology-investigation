Two machines Ark: 28 cores 1/2 TB ram 40 tB disk 2TB no GPU
ARK also has data sets for us.

The Sloan Digital Sky data sounds ineresting Biological data
(Molecular Data) Hamming distance on sequences (which is a metric)


Minski: 128 GRAM, TESLA GPU
These are all internal

London: An account we can ssh in and hop on to these.

Two data sets from different processes? PH is one tool, another is
histogram of distances between random subsets.

Alpha complexes: staring with a convex hull, reduce some factor and
