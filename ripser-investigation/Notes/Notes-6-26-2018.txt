I'm trying to figure out al the indirection here. so some types might help

a value_t is a double
an entry_t is an index_t is a long long

A diameter_index_t is a (value_t, index_t) pair
So a diameter entry is a (value_t, entry_t) pair

get_diameter(diameter_index) returns the first value of a
diameter_index which makes me think it's an actual diameter

get_index(diameter_index) returns the second, which makes me think
it's an index.

get_entry(diamter_entry) returns the second, which makes me think it's
an entry in something.

get_index(diameter_entry) returns the get_index(get_entry(argument))
which returns the second of the pair, which is of type entry_t, and so
get_index(entry_t) , which is an entry type, so it just returns itself
right? So that's the same as just returning the scond right? So
get_entry(diameter_index) and get_index(diamater_index) return the
same thing?

system ark 28 cores, 512G ram 40 TB of disk, + 2TB of SSD in
/scratch. /data is a RAID10 with 22 T and where I can put data.

minsky 64G of RAM (128 soon?) 16 cores (32 threads). /data is 6T
single disk mounts data from ark through a 10gB link and a NVIDIA
TESLA.

in /data on ark I have a directory on /data.

virtualenv is a sandbox for something .. ignore

in /data/ndaniels has pf3k which has malaria data

in /data/glamagna he has apogee and eboss stuff. original data in eboss.

Two collections in astronomy data: apogee and eboss. These are spectral data

The apgoee.normalized.tsv or apogee.tsv. There re memmap files there
that Greg has probably read in and saved.

The biological data is in
/data/ndaniels/Isolated_name_strains_165_aligned.fasta

These are "onehots" encoding, converting the ascii to 5 bit
characters, where 1 bit is set: the A, C, G, T and - file.  The
distance function is hamming on that.

GreenGenes data base has a download area: greengenes.secondgenome.com

There's a paper there ate aem.asm.org (might have to be on the URI net for that)
Treat dots and dashes as the same

Try this on ark.

Need a barcode plotter for the output of ripser.

The statement is everything on the line after the header line

The LDM will be the dot product between the onehots encoding
