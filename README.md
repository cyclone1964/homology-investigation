This respository is a running set of the investigations that Matt
Daily and Pawan Padney are doing for Dr. Noah Daniels into the
applicability of topological homology to investigation of large data
sets (> 1Gb).

Currently this is limited to the application of the ripser program to
compute vietoris-rips barcodes and analyzing them. This work is found
in the ripser-investigation directory.
